                    manner of Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van 
                    Gogh's (1853â€“1890) paintings had a significant impact 
                    on modern art. He is now recognized as one of the greatest

                <h2>Early Life and Artistic Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Van Gogh was born in Zundert, Netherlands, on March 30, 1853. 
                    Before deciding to paint full-time at the age of 27, he 
                    worked as a missionary, teacher, and art dealer. His earliest 
                    pieces, such The Potato Eaters (1885), have earthy, somber tones 
                    and portray rural life.</p>

                <h2>Challenges with Mental Health</h2>
                <p>Van Gogh battled mental illness throughout of his life, including 
                    psychotic episodes and sadness. After a disagreement with fellow 
                    artist Paul Gauguin, he cut off a portion of his ear, which is his 
                    most famous personal incident. He persevered in his art despite his 
                    struggles, creating more than 2,100 pieces in a ten-year period.</p>

                <h2>Influences Left on the World</h2>
                <p>At the age of 37, Van Gogh passed away in 1890. Although he only ever 
                    sold one artwork in his lifetime, his legend flourished after his 
                    passing. His impact can be observed in modern and contemporary art 
                    movements, and his pieces currently command some of the highest prices 
                    on the art market. Millions of people visit museums honoring his life and 
                    work every year, like Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum.</p>
